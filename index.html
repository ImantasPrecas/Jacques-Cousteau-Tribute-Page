            <h2 class="info-title">Who Was Jacques Cousteau?</h2>
            <p class="info-content">Undersea explorer Jacques Cousteau co-invented the Aqua-Lung, a breathing device
                for scuba-diving, in 1943. In 1945, he started the French Navy's undersea research group. In 1951,
                he began going on yearly trips to explore the ocean on the Calypso. Cousteau recorded his trips on
                the TV series The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau. In 1996, the Calypso sunk.</p>
            <h2 class="info-title">Famed Explorer and Inventing the Aqua-Lung</h2>
            <p class="info-content">During World War II, when Paris fell to the Nazis, Cousteau and his family took
                refuge in the small town of Megreve, near the Swiss border. For the first few years of the war, he
                quietly continued his underwater experiments and explorations. In 1943, he met Emile Gagnan, a
                French engineer who shared his passion for discovery. Around this time, compressed air cylinders
                were invented and Cousteau and Gagnan experimented with snorkel hoses, body suits and breathing
                apparatus.<br>

            </div>
            <p class="info-content"> In time, they developed the first aqua-lung device allowing divers to stay
                underwater for
                long periods of time. Cousteau was also instrumental in the development of a waterproof camera that
                could withstand the high pressure of deep water. During this time, Cousteau made two documentaries
                on underwater exploration, <em>Par dix-huit mètres de fond</em> ("18 Meters Deep") and <em>Épaves
                </em>("Shipwrecks"). </p>
            <p class="info-content"> <br>During the war, Cousteau joined the French Resistance movement, spying on
                Italian
                armed forces and documenting troop movements. Cousteau was recognized for his resistance efforts and
                awarded several medals, including the Legion of Honor from France. After the war, Cousteau worked
                with the French navy to clear underwater mines. Between missions, he continued his underwater
                explorations performing various tests and filming the underwater excursions.<br> </p>
            <p class="info-content"> In 1948, Cousteau, along with Philippe Tailliez and expert divers and academic
                scientists, undertook
                an underwater expedition in the Mediterranean Sea to find the Roman shipwreck <em>Mahdia</em>.

            </p>
            <p class="info-content"> This was the first underwater archaeology operation using self-contained diving
                apparatus and marked the
                beginning of underwater archeology.<br></p>

            <p class="info-content"> In 1950, Cousteau leased a one-time British minesweeper and converted it into an
                oceanographic
                research vessel he named <em>Calypso.</em></p>
